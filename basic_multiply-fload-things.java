/**
* -- In the above program, we have two floating-point numbers 1.5f and 2.0f stored in variables first and second respectively.

* -- Notice, we have used f after the numbers. This ensures the numbers are float, otherwise they will be assigned - type double.

* -- first and second are then multiplied using the * operator and the result is stored in a new float variable product.

* -- Finally, the result product is printed on the screen using println() function.
